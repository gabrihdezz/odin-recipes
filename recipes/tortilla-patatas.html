        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tortilla de patatas is a <strong>Spanish omelette</strong> made from thinly sliced potatoes and onions, 
            cooked in olive oil, and bound with a simple egg mixture.</p> 
        <p>Serve warm or at room temperature for a delicious tapa or appetizer.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add olive oil to a 10 or 12 inch skillet over medium heat. (It’s best to use a skillet that is at least 1 ½ inches deep.)</li>
            <li>Add sliced potato and onion to the pan; they should be mostly covered with olive oil (add a little more oil if needed).</li>
            <li>Season with 1 ½ teaspoon sea salt.</li>
            <li>Cook on medium-high heat, maintaining a gentle boil, for 8-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until potatoes are just fork tender. Don’t overcook them!</li>
            <li>Drain potatoes, reserving oil for later use. Taste and season potatoes with more salt, if needed. Allow them to cool for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile crack the eggs into a bowl and season with about ½ teaspoon of salt. Beat the eggs together and pour over the cooked potatoes and onion and toss to coat.</li>
            <li>Add a little bit of oil to the bottom of a 10-inch non-stick skillet over high heat. Once hot, pour potato mixture into it and cook on high heat for 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook for about 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
